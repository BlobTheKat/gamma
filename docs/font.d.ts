	 * Create a BreakToken. Group many `BreakToken`s into an array (a "token class") to fully specify how a piece of text should be tokenized, which defines how and where text can be broken by the `RichText.break()` function. 
	 * @param regex A regular expression defining what this token matches, e.g /\w+/y to match a word. Should have the `y` flag and no `g` flag (Otherwise, they will be added/removed for you, which will come at a small but potentially unnecessary cost)
	 * 
	 * If a string is passed, the pattern will match any amount of those characters. For example, `"0123456789"` will match any number of digits
	 * 
	 * @param type The token type, which is one of
	 *    - `BreakToken.NORMAL` If token takes up 50% or more of the current line, break it up into two. Otherwise, put it all on the next line.
	 *    - `BreakToken.NEVER_BREAK` Token cannot be broken up. Always put it on the next line
	 *    - `BreakToken.ALWAYS_BREAK` Token should always be broken into two or more wherever appropriate.
	 *    - `BreakToken.OVERFLOW` Token should overflow the line and never create a new line
	 *    - `BreakToken.VANISH` Token is not rendered at all when it surpasses the end of a line
	 *    - `BreakToken.TRUNCATE` Like VANISH, but only the characters that surpass the end of a line are not rendered
	 *    - `BreakToken.SQUISH` Token is squished (scaled X) to prevent overflowing.
	 *    - `BreakToken.SQUISH_BREAK` Token is squished by up to 50%, beyond which it will be broken into 2 instead. Provided as a more sane alternative to SQUISH
	 * 
	 * Additionally, the type can be OR'd with any number of the following flags. These always have an effect, even when the token doesn't overflow a line
	 *    - `BreakToken.WRAP_AFTER` Always create a new line after this token. Useful to make the newline character `\n` actually work.
	 *    - `BreakToken.WRAP_BEFORE` Always create a new line before this token. Can be used as an alternative to WRAP_AFTER in specific cases, or combined to make this token always stand on its own line
	 *    - `BreakToken.INVISIBLE` This token is never rendered
	 * @param separator A separator to be inserted when the token is broken (if it can be broken). For example, a `-` is often inserted to indicate a word was split across to the next line
	 * @param next Next token class. If this token is matched, the next part of the string will use a different set of BreakTokens to tokenize. You can create multiple arrays of `BreakToken`s that point to each other in this fashion to create far more complex context-sensitive tokenization. Leave unspecified to not make use of this feature (the next part of the string to be tokenized will use the exact same token class as this one)
